Our website's aim is to help the small businesses that have gone out of business due to this pandemic.
Our website named "Kraftify" is a website that allows users to register their business with us and our job is to promote their business. For registration,
we have provided a "Register with us" option which when clicked, directs the user to a form in which they can register their business with us.

Our landing page consists of advertisements of the products/shops who are a part of our community. There is a header which  consists of our logo and some
designing. Then, there is a navbar which consists of various hyperlinks which directs the visitor to various sections of our website.
There is a shop with us option in the navbar which allows the visitor to shop the products advertised on our website.
The visitor is provided with two options when they visit the product page, they can either order the product for home delivery or if they live in
the same city as the seller, they can themselves go and collect the order.
Our website consists of a few animations like the slide-in animation, in which the sections slide into the webpage as the website is being scrolled.

In the "Shop with us" section, we get to see the double navbar setup. The second navbar displays all the categories of the products being sold on our
website. While the user hovers over these categories they are able to see the sub-categories. For example:-
  categories -> Clothes -> Men's Wear -> Shirts/Trousers
  Apart from the navbar, the shop with us section consists of advertisements from our registered users consisting of various discount offers given by them.

  We also have a cart in our website which adds the selected products and adds the total cart amount in real-time. The cart is available in the navbar
  section. A few animations have been added to the cart to make it more appealing.
  We have also added a filter search engine in our website which will help the user in filtering the thing they are specifically looking for.

  There is a sign-in/sign-up feature in our website which allows the user to login to save the products, addresses, name, contact number etc. for future reference.

  The main file used for our website are index.html and index.css. There are a various others files also that are added into our website consisting of javascript, django and a few other html and css file and the images used in our website.
